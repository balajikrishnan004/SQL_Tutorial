# SQL



# Introduction

- Database is collection of data
- Structured Query Language(SQL) lets you perform CRUD operations Create/Read/Update or Delete operations on a database
- Database Management System(DBMS) is a software interface between database and end user that is responsible for authentication, concurrency, logging, backup, optimization etc.
- There are many types of database - Relational, Hierarchical, Network, NoSQL etc.
- Examples of RDBMS
    - MySql – OpenSource
    - SQL Server – Microsoft
    - Oracle – IBM
    - PostgreSQL - OpenSource

Following tutorial is for SQL with MySql dbms. The same can be used for other dbms with little or no modifications.

# DataTypes

## Character Data

**char** - eg:char(5) stores fixed length string of length 5.   Max 255 bytes.

**varchar** - eg:varchar(5) stores variable length string of length 5. Max 65535 bytes.

```sql
SHOW CHARACTER SET; -- shows various character sets that are supported.
```

latin1 is the default character set. We can also choose a specific character set like below,

```sql
varchar(10) character set utf8    -- the particular column is set to utf8
create database foreign_sales character set utf8;   -- entire database is set to utf8
```

# Basic Queries

## Database queries

```sql
CREATE DATABASE LOGICFIRST; -- creates a new database
-- TO DELETE A DATABASE
DROP DATABASE LOGICFIRST;
DROP SCHEMA LOGICFIRST; -- same as above. u can use DATABASE Or SCHEMA
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS LOGICFIRST; -- prevents error if db not found

SHOW DATABASES; -- shows all the databases
SHOW SCHEMAS; -- same as above. shows schemas/db

USE SYS; -- uses this database for all further commands
SHOW TABLES;-- shows all tables in the database being used
```

## Table - Create,Delete,Alter

primary key - uniquely identifies a row in a table

```sql
//creating a table
CREATE TABLE student(
	id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(30),
    gpa DECIMAL(3,2)
);
-- ----or-----
CREATE TABLE student( 
	id INT,
    name VARCHAR(30),
    gpa DECIMAL(3,2),
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

DROP TABLE student; -- drops the table

DESCRIBE student; -- describes the columns in the table student

ALTER TABLE student ADD department VARCHAR(5); -- Adds a new column department to the student table

ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN department; -- drops the department column from student table
-- ---or---
ALTER TABLE student DROP department; -- same as above

```

## Inserting Data

```sql
INSERT INTO student VALUES(1,"Aarthi",7.6);
INSERT INTO student VALUES(2,"Anitha",8.5); -- inserts a row. give values in column order

INSERT INTO student VALUES
(3,"Anitha",8.5),
(4,"Arul",8.2),
(5,"Ashwin",7.6); -- inserts more than one row

INSERT INTO student(id,name) VALUES(5,"Balaji"),(6,"Chandru"); -- inserts specific columns.

```

## Select

```sql
SELECT * FROM student; -- displays all rows and columns in the student table
SELECT id,name FROM student; -- displays specific columns
```

# Where Clause and Conditions

where is used to filter the records. The rows are filtered based on conditions. 

- **Query for Employee table** (click the initial arrow to expand)
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ename VARCHAR(30),
    job_desc VARCHAR(20),
    salary INT );
    
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(1,'Ram','ADMIN',1000000);
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(2,'Harini','MANAGER',2500000);
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(3,'George','SALES',2000000);
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(4,'Ramya','SALES',1300000);
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(5,'Meena','HR',2000000);
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(6,'Ashok','MANAGER',3000000);
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(7,'Abdul','HR',2000000);
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(8,'Ramya','ENGINEER',1000000);
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(9,'Raghu','CEO',8000000);
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(10,'Arvind','MANAGER',2800000);
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(11,'Akshay','ENGINEER',1000000);
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(12,'John','ADMIN',2200000);
    INSERT INTO employee VALUES(13,'Abinaya','ENGINEER',2100000);
    ```
    

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### SQL Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `=`      | Equal to |
| `>`      | Greater than |
| `<`      | Less than |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to |
| `<>`     | Not equal to<br>*(In some SQL versions, use `!=` instead)* |
| `BETWEEN`| Checks if a value is within a range |
| `LIKE`   | Searches for a pattern (used with wildcards) |
| `IN`     | Specifies multiple possible values |
| `NOT`    | Negates a condition |


AND/OR can be used to combine the relational operators.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE ename = 'Ramya'; 

SELECT emp_id,ename,salary FROM employee
WHERE salary>2000000; 

SELECT emp_id,ename,salary FROM employee
WHERE salary<2600000 AND job_desc = 'MANAGER'; 

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE job_desc='ADMIN' OR job_desc='HR'; -- though this works next command is a much better choice

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE job_desc IN ('ADMIN','HR'); 

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE job_desc NOT IN ('MANAGER','CEO');

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE salary BETWEEN 2000000 AND 3000000
LIMIT 5; --limits the records shown 

SELECT * FROM employee
LIMIT 5;  -- Different syntax in oracle/sql server
```

### Using Like and wildcards

LIKE  is used with WHERE clause for searching a specific pattern in a column. It is used along with the following wild cards

% represents zero or more characters

_ represents exactly one character

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE 'A%'; -- filters name starting with A

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE 'R%a'; -- filters name starting WITH R AND ending with a

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE '%I%'; -- filters name containing I

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE '__I%'; -- filters name with i as third character

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE ename LIKE 'R\%'; -- filters name starting with R%. \ is the escape character.
```

## Update and Delete

```sql
UPDATE employee
SET job_desc = "Analyst"; -- updates all job_desc of all rows to "Analyst" when safe update not enabled

UPDATE employee
SET job_desc = "Analyst"
WHERE job_desc = "Engineer"; -- changes Engineer to Analyst in all applicable rows

UPDATE employee
SET job_desc = "Analyst"
WHERE emp_id=1;

DELETE FROM employee; -- deletes all rows

DELETE from employee
WHERE emp_id = 12;
```

# Distinct

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT job_desc
FROM employee; -- shows only distinct values without duplicates
```

# Order By

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee
ORDER BY salary; -- order by salary asc

SELECT * FROM employee
ORDER BY salary ASC; -- order by salary asc

SELECT * FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC; -- order by salary desc

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE job_desc="MANAGER"
ORDER BY salary DESC; -- order the manager salaries in desc order

SELECT * FROM employee
ORDER BY job_desc,ename; -- first sorts by job_desc and then by ename

SELECT * FROM employee
ORDER BY (CASE job_desc -- specific order
WHEN 'CEO' THEN 1
WHEN 'MANAGER' THEN 2
WHEN 'HR' THEN 3
WHEN 'ANALYST' THEN 4
WHEN 'SALES' THEN 5
ELSE 100 END);
```

# Copy Table

```sql
INSERT INTO first_table_name [(column1, column2, ... columnN)] 
   SELECT column1, column2, ...columnN 
   FROM second_table_name
```

# Functions

- Here is good source for learning all functions [https://www.techonthenet.com/mysql/functions/index.php](https://www.techonthenet.com/mysql/functions/index.php)
    
    aggregate functions [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html)
    

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee; -- total count of entries in the table

SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee; -- avg salary of all employees

SELECT AVG(salary) 
FROM employee
WHERE job_desc="MANAGER"; -- avg salary of managers

SELECT SUM(salary)
FROM employee
WHERE job_desc="ANALYST"; -- total salary given to all analysts

SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM employee);  -- display the employee with 

SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employee;

SELECT UCASE(ename),salary
FROM employee; -- uppercase

SELECT ename,CHAR_LENGTH(ename)
FROM employee; 

SELECT ename,CONCAT("Rs.",salary)
FROM employee; -- adds Rs. to the beginning of salary

SELECT ename,CONCAT("Rs.",FORMAT(salary,0))
FROM employee; -- formats the number to add comma. The second argument(0 here) represents digits to round off after decimal

SELECT ename,LEFT(job_desc,4)
FROM employee; -- returns only the first 4 characters of the ename
```

---

# Using Date

```sql
ALTER TABLE employee ADD COLUMN Hire_Date DATE; -- adding hire_date column

UPDATE  employee
SET Hire_Date="2012-10-05"; -- updating hire_date

UPDATE  employee
SET Hire_Date="2014-10-05"
WHERE job_desc = "ANALYST"; -- updating hire_date

SELECT NOW(); -- Current date and time 

SELECT DATE(NOW()); -- current date

SELECT CURDATE(); -- current system date

SELECT DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE(),'%d/%m/%Y'); -- to change the display format. use %d %m and %y or %Y in required format.

SELECT DATEDIFF(CURDATE(),'2020-01-01') DAYS; -- to calculate date difference
```

```sql
SELECT CURDATE() 'start date',
 DATE_ADD(CURDATE(),INTERVAL 1 DAY) 'one day later',
 DATE_ADD(CURDATE(),INTERVAL 1 WEEK) 'one week later',
 DATE_ADD(CURDATE(),INTERVAL 1 MONTH) 'one month later',x
 DATE_ADD(CURDATE(),INTERVAL 1 YEAR) 'one year later';
```

# Group By and Having

Group by is used to group the table based on conditions and analyze values within the group using aggregate functions.

Where is used to filter the rows before grouping. Having is used to filter the groups.

```sql
SELECT job_desc,FORMAT(AVG(salary),0) avg_sal
FROM employee
GROUP BY job_desc; -- shows avg salary of each category within job_desc
```

![Untitled](Untitled%205.png)

```sql
SELECT job_desc,COUNT(emp_id) count
FROM employee
GROUP BY job_desc; -- displays number of employees count in each job_desc category
```

![Untitled](Untitled%206.png)

```sql
SELECT job_desc,COUNT(emp_id) AS count -- using as for aliasing
FROM employee
GROUP BY job_desc
HAVING COUNT(emp_id)>1; --  displays number of employees count in each job_desc category only when count is greater than 1.

SELECT job_desc,COUNT(emp_id) AS count
FROM employee
GROUP BY job_desc
HAVING COUNT(emp_id)>1
ORDER BY job_desc;  -- same as above ordered by job_desc asc

SELECT job_desc,COUNT(emp_id) AS count
FROM employee
GROUP BY job_desc
HAVING COUNT(emp_id)>1
ORDER BY COUNT(emp_id) DESC  -- same but ordered by Desc order of COUNT in each group

SELECT job_desc,COUNT(emp_id) AS count
FROM employee
WHERE salary>1500000
GROUP BY job_desc
HAVING COUNT(emp_id)>1
ORDER BY COUNT(emp_id) DESC; -- with additional filtering of salary> 15L. Only those with sal more than 15L is considered for grouping
```

# Constraints

NOT NULL, AUTO_INCREMENT, DEFAULT, CHECK, UNIQUE

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, -- id will be auto incremented for new rows
ename VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL, -- null value cannot be inserted for the column
job_desc VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'unassigned', -- sets default when not mentioned
salary INT,
pan VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE,-- cannot contain duplicates
CHECK (salary>100000)); 

INSERT INTO employee(ename,salary) VALUES ('Ramya',1000000);
INSERT INTO employee(ename,salary) VALUES ('Riya',10000); -- erros because of violation of salary check constraint
SELECT * FROM employee;
```

## Foreign Key

Foreign key is a field in one table referring to the primary key of another table.

```sql

-- drop previously created tables and create a branch table
CREATE TABLE branch (
branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
br_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
addr VARCHAR(200) );

-- create employee table with branch_id as foreign key. It refers to the branch_id of branch table.
CREATE TABLE employee (
emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
ename VARCHAR(30),
job_desc VARCHAR(20),
salary INT,
branch_id INT,
CONSTRAINT FK_branchId FOREIGN KEY(branch_id) REFERENCES branch(branch_id));

-- droping FK
ALTER TABLE employee
DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_branchId;
```

## Index

Index are used for fast lookups. Speeds up select query but delays insert/update. Also take up more memory.

```sql
SHOW INDEX FROM employee; -- show current indices

CREATE INDEX name_index ON employee(ename); -- creates a new index

ALTER TABLE employee
DROP INDEX name_index; -- drop index

ALTER TABLE employee
ADD INDEX(ename); -- create index using alter command 
```

## On Delete

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
ename VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
job_desc VARCHAR(20),
salary INT,
branch_id INT,
CONSTRAINT FK_branchId FOREIGN KEY(branch_id) REFERENCES branch(branch_id) 
ON DELETE CASCADE -- on deleting a row in branch table, the corresponding entries in employee table will be deleted
);

CREATE TABLE employee (
emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
ename VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
job_desc VARCHAR(20),
salary INT,
branch_id INT,
CONSTRAINT FK_branchId FOREIGN KEY(branch_id) REFERENCES branch(branch_id) 
ON DELETE SET NULL -- on deleting a row in branch table, the branchid corresponding entries in employee table will be made null
);
```

## Joins

Joins are used to join columns from two tables

```sql
DROP TABLE employee; -- drop and freshly create

CREATE TABLE branch (
branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
br_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
addr VARCHAR(200) );

CREATE TABLE employee (
emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
ename VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
job_desc VARCHAR(20),
salary INT,
branch_id INT,
CONSTRAINT FK_branchId FOREIGN KEY(branch_id) REFERENCES branch(branch_id)
);

INSERT INTO branch VALUES(1,"Chennai","16 ABC Road");
INSERT INTO branch VALUES(2,"Coimbatore","120 15th Block");
INSERT INTO branch VALUES(3,"Mumbai","25 XYZ Road");
INSERT INTO branch VALUES(4,"Hydrabad","32 10th Street");

INSERT INTO employee VALUES(1,'Ram','ADMIN',1000000,2);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(2,'Harini','MANAGER',2500000,2);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(3,'George','SALES',2000000,1);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(4,'Ramya','SALES',1300000,2);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(5,'Meena','HR',2000000,3);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(6,'Ashok','MANAGER',3000000,1);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(7,'Abdul','HR',2000000,1);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(8,'Ramya','ENGINEER',1000000,2);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(9,'Raghu','CEO',8000000,3);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(10,'Arvind','MANAGER',2800000,3);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(11,'Akshay','ENGINEER',1000000,1);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(12,'John','ADMIN',2200000,1);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(13,'Abinaya','ENGINEER',2100000,2);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(14,'Vidya','ADMIN',2200000,NULL);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(15,'Ranjani','ENGINEER',2100000,NULL);

SELECT * FROM employee;
SELECT * FROM branch;

-- inner join: only matching rows
SELECT employee.emp_id,employee.ename,employee.job_desc,branch.br_name
FROM employee
INNER JOIN branch
ON employee.branch_id=branch.branch_id
ORDER BY emp_id;

-- below query gives same result without using join keyword
SELECT employee.emp_id,employee.ename,employee.job_desc,branch.br_name
FROM employee,branch
WHERE employee.branch_id=branch.branch_id
ORDER BY emp_id;

-- using table name alias
SELECT e.emp_id,e.ename,e.job_desc,b.br_name
FROM employee AS e
INNER JOIN branch AS b
ON e.branch_id=b.branch_id
ORDER BY e.emp_id;

-- Right join is matched rows + all other rows in right table
SELECT employee.emp_id,employee.ename,employee.job_desc,branch.br_name
FROM employee
RIGHT JOIN branch
ON employee.branch_id=branch.branch_id
ORDER BY emp_id;

-- Left join is matched rows with all other rows in left table 
SELECT employee.emp_id,employee.ename,employee.job_desc,branch.br_name
FROM employee
LEFT JOIN branch
ON employee.branch_id=branch.branch_id
ORDER BY emp_id;

-- Cross join joins each row of first table with every other row of second table
SELECT employee.emp_id,employee.ename,employee.job_desc,branch.br_name
FROM employee
CROSS JOIN branch;

-- displays the employee count in each branch
SELECT b.br_name,COUNT(e.emp_id)
FROM branch as b
JOIN employee as e
ON b.branch_id = e.branch_id
GROUP BY e.branch_id;
```

## Union

union combines two table having equal number of columns and matching datatypes

```sql
-- create client table similar to branch table
CREATE TABLE clients (
client_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
location VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
addr VARCHAR(200) );

INSERT INTO clients VALUES(1,"NewYork","25 10th Block");
INSERT INTO clients VALUES(2,"Coimbatore","120 15th Block");
INSERT INTO clients VALUES(3,"London","21 ABC Road");

-- combines the two tables removing duplicates
SELECT * FROM branch
UNION 
SELECT * FROM clients;

-- combines the two tables without removing duplicates
SELECT * FROM branch
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM clients;
```

## Subqueries, Exists, Any, All

Subqueries combine more than 2 queries.

```sql
-- Displays employee list in Chennai Branch
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE branch_id = (SELECT branch_id
FROM branch
WHERE br_name="Chennai");

-- Displays the employees with min salary
SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE salary = (SELECT MIN(salary)
FROM employee);

	- displays the branches containing atleast one admin
SELECT branch_id,br_name
FROM branch
WHERE EXISTS 
( SELECT * FROM employee
WHERE job_desc="ADMIN" AND branch.branch_id = employee.branch_id);

-- displays the branch info in which any employee gets more than 25L
SELECT branch_id,br_name
FROM branch
WHERE branch_id = ANY
(SELECT branch_id FROM employee
WHERE salary>2500000);

-- displays employees not working in chennai or coimbatore

SELECT * FROM employee 
WHERE branch_id <> ALL ( SELECT branch_id FROM branch
WHERE br_name IN ("Chennai","Coimbatore"));
```

## Views

```sql
CREATE VIEW emp_br
AS
SELECT employee.emp_id,employee.ename,employee.job_desc,branch.br_name
FROM employee
INNER JOIN branch
ON employee.branch_id=branch.branch_id
ORDER BY emp_id;

SELECT * FROM emp_br; -- selecting all rows from view

DROP VIEW emp_br; -- delete view

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW emp_br  -- modify view
AS 
SELECT employee.emp_id,employee.ename,employee.job_desc,branch.br_name
FROM employee
INNER JOIN branch
ON employee.branch_id=branch.branch_id;
```
